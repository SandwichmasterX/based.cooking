# Vegetarian Black Bean Chili

Great for feeding a family. Relatively easy to make, but you'll definitely want to experiment a bit with the recipe. This recipe makes a lot, you can freeze it and reheat it for future dinners.
Can be served with rice/pasta and cheese, on hot dogs, or eaten as is. I've had it all four ways and it holds up each way.

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium white onion, diced
- 3 bell peppers, diced
- 1 clove fresh garlic, diced or minced
- 2 Tbsp chili powder
- 2 Tbsp ground cumin
- 2 Tbsp cocoa powder (Trust me)
- A few shakes of red pepper flakes (optional)
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce (optional)
- 4 cans of black beans (I usually swap a can for red kidney beans for variety)
- 2 cans crushed or diced tomatoes (or a few diced up fresh ones if you've got the time)
- 1/2 cup bulgur (Again, trust me. Bulgur is not optional here.)
- 3 to 4 cups water
- 1 can drained corn

## Directions

1. Saut√© the onion in olive oil in a large pot over medium heat until translucent. Add peppers and cook until the peppers soften slightly.
2. Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, cocoa powder, pepper flakes, and soy sauce. Give it a good stir.
3. Drain and rinse the beans and add them to the pot, along with the tomatoes. Stir again.
4. Add the bulgur and water. Reduce heat to low.
5. **Stir every ten minutes** until it reaches the desired consistency- probably at least an hour, maybe up to two. It depends on how thick or watery you like it. Add the corn if desired and stir.
6. Enjoy!
